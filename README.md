git-rebase-interactive-demo
===========================

This repository has bad history (intentionally). It is used to demo git rebase interactive command.
What's wrong with those commits:
- The commit title for gitignore file is called 'svnignore' (use reword). Could be reorder has one of the first commit.
- The commit 'Add main class for running app' has a file with a missing semi-colon (use edit)
- 4 commits can be merged for the config.properties file (use squash)
